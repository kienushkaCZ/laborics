<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
<p class="policy-meta">Effective date: February 1, 2026 &middot; Last updated: February 1, 2026</p>

<p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the Laborics platform ("Service"), operated by <strong>Reload dev s.r.o.</strong>, a company registered in the Czech Republic, IČO: 24831905, DIČ: CZ699006763, with its registered office at Vinohradská 2133/138, Vinohrady, 130 00 Praha 3 ("Company", "we", "us").</p>

<p>By creating an account or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.</p>

<h2>1. About the Service</h2>

<p>Laborics is an AI-powered document creation and formatting service. Users can create documents from scratch by providing instructions in natural language, or upload existing documents for reformatting. The Service processes documents using artificial intelligence and delivers results in .docx and PDF formats.</p>

<h2>2. Account Registration</h2>

<p>To use the Service, you must create an account with a valid email address. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activity that occurs under your account. You must notify us immediately at <a href="mailto:hello@laborics.com">hello@laborics.com</a> if you suspect unauthorized access.</p>

<p>You must be at least 18 years old to use the Service.</p>

<h2>3. Credits and Payment</h2>

<h3>3.1 Credit System</h3>
<p>The Service operates on a prepaid credit system. Credits are used to process document tasks. The number of credits consumed per task depends on the complexity and length of the document.</p>

<h3>3.2 Purchasing Credits</h3>
<p>Credits are available for purchase through the Service via Stripe. All prices are listed in EUR excluding VAT. VAT is applied at checkout based on your location. EU businesses with a valid VAT ID may purchase VAT-free under the reverse charge mechanism.</p>

<h3>3.3 No Expiration</h3>
<p>Purchased credits do not expire. You may use them at any time as long as your account is active.</p>

<h3>3.4 Refunds</h3>
<p>Credit purchases are generally non-refundable. However, in accordance with Czech consumer protection law (Act No. 634/1992 Coll.) and EU Directive 2011/83/EU, consumers located in the EU have the right to withdraw from a distance contract within 14 days of purchase without giving a reason — provided the credits have not yet been used. To exercise this right, contact us at <a href="mailto:hello@laborics.com">hello@laborics.com</a>.</p>

<p>If credits have been partially used, the refund will be calculated proportionally for the unused portion.</p>

<h3>3.5 Free Trial Credits</h3>
<p>We may offer free trial credits to new users. Trial credits are subject to the same terms as purchased credits and cannot be exchanged for cash.</p>

<h2>4. Acceptable Use</h2>

<p>You agree not to use the Service to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Generate illegal, fraudulent, or harmful content</li>
    <li>Produce documents intended to deceive, impersonate, or defraud others</li>
    <li>Violate any applicable laws or regulations</li>
    <li>Interfere with or disrupt the Service or its infrastructure</li>
    <li>Reverse-engineer, decompile, or attempt to extract source code from the Service</li>
    <li>Resell or redistribute access to the Service without our prior written consent</li>
</ul>

<p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts that violate these terms.</p>

<h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>

<h3>5.1 Your Content</h3>
<p>You retain full ownership of all documents you upload to or create through the Service. We do not claim any intellectual property rights over your content.</p>

<h3>5.2 Our Service</h3>
<p>The Laborics platform, including its design, code, AI models, and branding, is the intellectual property of Reload dev s.r.o. These Terms do not grant you any rights to our intellectual property beyond what is necessary to use the Service.</p>

<h3>5.3 No Training on Your Data</h3>
<p>We do not use your documents or content to train AI models.</p>

<h2>6. Document Storage</h2>

<p>Documents created or uploaded through the Service are stored in your personal workspace. You have full control over your files and can download or delete them at any time through your dashboard. If you delete your account, all associated documents will be permanently removed within 30 days.</p>

<h2>7. Service Availability</h2>

<p>We strive to maintain high availability of the Service but do not guarantee uninterrupted access. The Service may be temporarily unavailable due to maintenance, updates, or circumstances beyond our control. We will make reasonable efforts to notify users of planned downtime in advance.</p>

<h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>

<p>The Service is provided "as is" and "as available". To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law:</p>

<ul>
    <li>We do not warrant that the Service will be error-free or that AI-generated output will be accurate, complete, or fit for any particular purpose.</li>
    <li>You are responsible for reviewing all documents produced by the Service before using them for business, legal, or other purposes.</li>
    <li>Our total liability for any claims arising from the use of the Service shall not exceed the amount you have paid to us in the 12 months preceding the claim.</li>
    <li>We shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages.</li>
</ul>

<h2>9. Termination</h2>

<p>You may terminate your account at any time by contacting us at <a href="mailto:hello@laborics.com">hello@laborics.com</a> or through the account settings in your dashboard. Unused credits at the time of voluntary termination are non-refundable unless required by applicable law.</p>

<p>We may terminate or suspend your account if you violate these Terms, with or without prior notice depending on the severity of the violation.</p>

<h2>10. Changes to These Terms</h2>

<p>We may update these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we will notify you by email or through the Service at least 14 days before the changes take effect. Your continued use of the Service after the changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>

<h2>11. Governing Law and Disputes</h2>

<p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the Czech Republic. Any disputes arising from or in connection with these Terms shall be resolved by the competent courts of the Czech Republic.</p>

<p>If you are a consumer in the EU, you may also use the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EU Online Dispute Resolution platform</a>.</p>
